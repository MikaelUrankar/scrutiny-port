Scrutiny is a simple but focused application, with a couple of core features:
 - Web UI Dashboard - focused on Critical metrics
 - smartd integration (no re-inventing the wheel)
 - Auto-detection of all connected hard-drives
 - S.M.A.R.T metric tracking for historical trends
 - Customized thresholds using real world failure rates
 - Temperature tracking
 - Provided as an all-in-one Docker image (but can be installed manually)
 - Configurable Alerting/Notifications via Webhooks
 - (Future) Hard Drive performance testing & tracking
